# Flappy Bird AI - Deep Q-Learning (DQN)

A reinforcement learning-based AI that learns to play Flappy Bird using Deep Q-Networks (DQN). The model is trained using experience replay and reward-based learning to optimize gameplay.

## Features

* **Deep Q-Learning (DQN):** Uses a neural network to approximate Q-values
* **Experience Replay:** Improves learning by storing past experiences
* **Pygame-based Simulation:** Real-time training and testing environment
* **Training Visualization:** Track the agent's learning progress over time

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow / PyTorch
* Pygame

### Installation

# Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Shresth-Deorari/Flappy-Bird
```
```
cd Flappy-Bird
```
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
python train.py
```

### Run Trained Model

```
python play.py
```
## How It Works

1. **State Representation:** The game state is represented using key parameters such as bird position, velocity, and pipe distance.
2. **Action Space:** The agent can either flap or do nothing.
3. **Reward System:**
   * +1 for staying alive
   * -100 for hitting an obstacle
4. **Training Process:** The agent improves decision-making by iterating over thousands of episodes and updating Q-values based on game outcomes.
